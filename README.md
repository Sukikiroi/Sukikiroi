👋 Hi, I’m a Full Stack Developer

👀 I’m interested in Web Apps, Distributed Systems, Microservices, and Bug Bounty.

🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into the Pub/Sub pattern and event-driven architectures.

💡 I’m exploring Kafka, RabbitMQ, and other messaging platforms to build scalable and resilient systems.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on system design projects that leverage the Pub/Sub pattern, Kafka, or event streaming platforms.

🎯 2025 Goals:
- Contribute to Open Source projects:
  - pentestgpt
  - python networking scripts
- Build and share a comprehensive guide on designing scalable systems using the Pub/Sub pattern.
- Mentor aspiring developers on system design and distributed systems.

**Explanation:**
  Core Simulation Engine: Handles the core logic of the simulation.
  Controller: Manages the simulation flow and coordinates between the engine and plugins.
  Plugin Manager: Loads and registers plugins dynamically.
  Plugin Interface: Defines the interaction methods for plugins.
  Plugins: Implement specific behaviors and interact with the engine using the defined interface.
